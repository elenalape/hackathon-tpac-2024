    <h1>ismap</h1>
    <p>
      Since time immemorial, the <code>img</code> element has had the
      <code>ismap</code> attribute.  There are many things you can do
      with it, and it was a staple of "fancy" web pages in the 90's.
      But modern JS and CSS tools have all but deprecated it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>ismap</code> only works if the <code>img</code> is
      inside an <code>a</code> (anchor/link), and will load the target
      with an added query string specifying the <i>x,y</i> coordinates
      of the pixel on which the mouse was clicked. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The apache httpd server has had the <code>mod_imagemap</code>
      module that allows developers to specify a mapping from points,
      polygons, etc. to specific URLs.  In the age of SPA, this has
      also become all but deprecated.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it can still be useful, even in a single page!
    </p>

    <p>
      Click on the image above, and see what happens.  The URL will
      change, and ... if I had more time I would have changed the
      background colour to what you clicked.

      PS: I built an <code>ismap</code> based interactive tour of the
      campus map of where I did my undergrad, and then sold it to the
      university in 1995.  Clicking on the campus map loaded a picture
      that I took with a film camera, had developed, and scanned with
      an old-school flatbed scanner.  Digital cameras were a thing,
      but not good at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      PPS: I wanted to do <code>&lt;blink/&gt;</code>, but it doesn't
      work anymore.
